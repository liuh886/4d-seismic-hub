# Welcome to the 4D Seismic Hub

Time‑lapse or **four‑dimensional (4D) seismic** monitoring is transforming the way we understand reservoirs, optimise production and plan infill drilling.  By comparing repeat seismic surveys over the same area, we can directly observe fluid movements, compaction and pressure changes – information that is essential for mature fields and complex carbonate reservoirs.  

This website is maintained by the 4D Seismic Hub Working Group to collect **open‑access presentations**, **case studies**, tutorials and best practices for 4D seismic monitoring.  Our goal is to provide a concise, decision‑oriented **abstract** of the practice of 4D seismic – a curated set of short summaries that point back to original sources and can be reused in conference abstracts, proposals and operational planning.  The hub grew out of a realisation during customer meetings that simply gathering publicly available materials and summarising them in one place would make a tangible difference.

On these pages you will find:

* A growing catalogue of publicly accessible papers and presentations, curated in our [Resources](/pages/resources) section.
* Example **case studies** illustrating how 4D seismic data has been used to inform reservoir management decisions.
* The **Working Group charter** and information on how to join our community or contribute your own materials.

In addition to these pages, we are developing a set of **reusable card templates** that distil key insights from 4D seismic practice:

* **Design checklists** summarising recommended repeatability metrics, normalisation strategies and attribute thresholds when designing a new monitor survey.
* **Case cards** capturing the question, workflow and outcome for specific 4D applications, allowing you to quickly see how data translated into decisions.
* **Pitfall notes** documenting common issues and mitigation strategies, helping newcomers avoid the same mistakes.

These cards turn long papers into concise abstracts and tie directly back to our resources.  You will find more information about them on the [About](/pages/about) page.

Whether you are an operator exploring an ocean‑bottom node (OBN) solution, a service provider developing new processing techniques, or a researcher looking for benchmark data, we invite you to browse the site, contribute and share your feedback.

> *This initiative is completely open and unfunded; we rely on volunteers to keep the content current.  If you would like to help maintain the site, please see our [Contribute](/pages/contribute) page.*
