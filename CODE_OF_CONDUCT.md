# Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).  We expect everyone participating in the **4D Seismic Hub** to uphold the following standards of behaviour:

* **Be respectful.**  Use welcoming and inclusive language.  Value differing viewpoints and experiences.  Provide constructive feedback, gracefully accepting it in return.
* **Be considerate.**  Remember that your contributions affect others.  Decisions and actions should account for the community as a whole.
* **Be collaborative.**  Share knowledge, and credit those who have helped you.  Seek consensus when making decisions.
* **Avoid harassment and exclusionary behaviour.**  Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to personal attributes, deliberate intimidation, stalking, unwanted sexual attention and discrimination.  Such behaviour is not tolerated.
* **Respect confidentiality.**  Do not share proprietary or confidential information.  Only contribute materials that are publicly available or that you have the right to share.

## Reporting issues

If you experience or witness behaviour that violates this code, please report it by opening a confidential issue or emailing one of the working group members directly.  Reports will be handled discreetly and promptly.  The working group reserves the right to remove contributors or members who violate the code.
