# 4D Seismic Hub Working Group Charter

## Purpose

The 4D Seismic Hub Working Group (hereafter “the WG”) exists to curate, maintain and promote the **4D Seismic Hub**.  Its primary responsibilities are to ensure the accuracy, legality and relevance of materials hosted on the associated GitHub Pages site, and to foster a collaborative community of practitioners.  The WG also guards the principle that the hub acts as an “online abstract” of open literature rather than a repository of proprietary data.

## Scope

The WG focuses on time‑lapse seismic monitoring, including but not limited to:

* Acquisition methods such as ocean‑bottom nodes, towed streamer repeats, permanent reservoir monitoring and fibre‑optic sensing.
* Processing and imaging workflows for 4D data, including repeatability analysis, inversion and integration with reservoir simulation.
* Case studies, tutorials and educational materials derived from publicly accessible sources.

The WG does not host proprietary data or materials that are subject to commercial confidentiality.  All contributions must comply with applicable licensing and copyright regulations.  Contributors are reminded that the purpose of the hub is to provide summaries (online abstracts) of publicly accessible work, not to reproduce that work verbatim.

## Membership

Membership is open to individuals with an interest in 4D seismic who are willing to volunteer time to review contributions and attend WG meetings.  There is no limit on the number of members.  Membership is obtained by adding oneself to the membership table in the `pages/working-group.md` file and notifying the WG via a labelled GitHub issue.  The WG may reject membership applications for cause (e.g. previous violation of the Code of Conduct).

## Meetings

The WG meets at least once per quarter via teleconference.  Additional meetings may be scheduled as needed.  Meetings are open to all members.  Agendas are circulated at least one week in advance.  Decisions are recorded in meeting minutes, which are published in the repository.

## Decision‑making

The WG strives for consensus.  If consensus cannot be reached, a simple majority vote will decide.  In the event of a tie, the chair (a rotating role among members) may cast the deciding vote or defer the decision to a subsequent meeting.  All decisions to merge contributions or modify the charter require a quorum of at least half of the active members.

## Code of Conduct

The WG adopts the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).  Members and contributors are expected to treat one another with respect.  Violations may result in removal from the WG and/or revocation of contribution privileges.
