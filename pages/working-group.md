## Working Group

The **4D Seismic Hub Working Group** oversees the curation and development of this project.  Its purpose is to ensure that contributions are accurate, properly attributed and consistent with the goals of the community.  Membership is open to anyone with a sustained interest in time‑lapse seismic who is willing to volunteer time to review pull requests, attend occasional meetings and help steer the project.  

Our first agenda item is to agree on the final name and scope of the hub; “4D Seismic Hub” is our working title and may evolve as the community grows.

### Mission

* Foster an open and collaborative environment for sharing 4D seismic knowledge.
* Maintain a high‑quality repository of open presentations, case studies, card templates and tutorials.
* Encourage best practices in acquisition, processing, inversion and interpretation of time‑lapse data.
* Provide a neutral forum where operators, service companies, academics and students can exchange ideas without commercial barriers.

### Structure and membership

The working group operates by consensus.  All members are equal; there are no formal roles beyond a rotating chair who schedules meetings and organises reviews.  Decisions about accepting new materials or changes to the site are made by simple majority vote among the members present at a meeting or via asynchronous online discussion.

Members typically meet quarterly via teleconference, with ad‑hoc meetings scheduled as necessary.  Meeting notes and action items are recorded and published in the repository under the `docs/` directory.  At the outset we anticipate a small core team who will refine the naming and direction of the project.
