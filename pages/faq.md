## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is 4D seismic?

4D (four‑dimensional) seismic refers to the comparison of repeat seismic surveys acquired over the same area at different times.  By analysing the differences between the baseline and monitor surveys, geoscientists can identify changes in fluid saturation, pressure and compaction within the reservoir.  The “fourth dimension” is time.

### Why host the hub on GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages provides a free, globally distributed hosting platform that integrates seamlessly with GitHub’s collaborative workflows.  Contributors can suggest changes via pull requests, and the working group can review and merge them.  The static site generator (Jekyll) allows us to manage content in simple Markdown and YAML files.  Hosting on GitHub makes it easy to treat the site as a living document — an “online abstract” that anyone can extend.

### Can I submit proprietary data?

No.  The hub only accepts materials that are already publicly available and do not contain confidential or proprietary information.  Case studies should anonymise field names and remove sensitive details.  The hub serves as a summary of open resources; it is not a repository for confidential data.  If in doubt, contact the working group before submitting.

### How should I cite the hub?

If you use information from this site in a publication, please cite the individual papers and presentations referenced.  For general acknowledgement of the hub itself, see the `CITATION.cff` file in the repository, which provides citation details in multiple formats.

### How can I join the working group?

Edit `pages/working-group.md` to add your name and a short biography to the table of members.  Then open an issue labelled `wg‑join` in the repository.  A member will contact you to confirm your interest and schedule you for the next meeting.
