## About the 4D Seismic Hub

The **4D Seismic Hub** is an open, volunteer‑driven community dedicated to advancing the science and practice of time‑lapse seismic monitoring.  Our mission is to create a central hub where practitioners can find, share and discuss resources related to 4D seismic, with a special emphasis on ocean‑bottom node (OBN) acquisition and carbonate reservoirs in the Middle East.  More than simply compiling links, the hub aims to act as an **online abstract**: short, decision‑oriented summaries point back to the original open materials, making it easy to reuse proven ideas in conference abstracts, project proposals or technical discussions.

### Our vision

We envision a world in which 4D seismic is not a niche technology but an integral part of reservoir management decisions.  By making publicly accessible presentations and case studies easy to find **and summarising them in reusable formats**, we aim to accelerate adoption and inspire new collaborations across disciplines, companies and continents.

### Why this hub?

In many fields today, teams reinvent the wheel because critical information is scattered across conference websites, paywalled journals and corporate intranets.  During a recent customer visit we realised that simply collecting and curating the available open materials—such as the EarthDoc papers listed in our resources—could make a tangible difference.  A GitHub Pages site is inexpensive to host, easy to maintain and allows anyone to contribute via familiar pull‑request workflows.  But beyond hosting a list of links, we wanted to provide a **clear, concise summary of what each work achieves**—an online abstract that can be cited on its own.  That insight led to the creation of this hub.

### What we provide

* **Curated resources** – The heart of the site is our [Resources](/pages/resources) page, automatically generated from a YAML file that lists publicly available papers and presentations.  Each entry includes the title, authors, year, a short description and tags to make searching easier.
* **Case studies** – We highlight examples where 4D data have informed reservoir decisions.  Each case study follows a simple template—what question was asked, how the data were processed and what was learned—so that readers can quickly grasp the relevance to their own field.
* **Reusable card templates** – To make our summaries both concise and actionable, we propose three standard card types:
  * **Design checklist** – a table of recommended repeatability metrics, normalisation strategies and attribute thresholds for designing new monitor surveys.
  * **Case card** – a structured snapshot of a specific 4D application, capturing the question, workflow and outcome so you can see how data translated into decisions.
  * **Pitfall note** – a short summary of common issues or lessons learned when acquiring or interpreting 4D data, along with mitigation strategies.

  These cards act as mini‑abstracts that can be reused in conference submissions or internal presentations.  Contributors are encouraged to populate them as they survey the literature.
* **Working group** – Behind the scenes is a small working group of volunteers who meet periodically to review contributions, approve pull requests and discuss the direction of the hub.  The charter and current membership are outlined on the [Working Group](/pages/working-group) page.  We welcome new members who share our enthusiasm.
* **Contribution guidelines** – To keep the site coherent and reliable, we ask contributors to follow the guidelines in our `CONTRIBUTING.md`.  Submissions should be based on publicly accessible materials with clear attribution and must not include confidential data.  When summarising a work, use your own words and link back to the original source; treat your contribution as an “online abstract” rather than a copy‑and‑paste.

### Who can participate?

Anyone with an interest in 4D seismic is encouraged to join.  You might be a geoscientist working for an operator, a processing specialist at a service company, a researcher developing novel algorithms, or a student eager to learn.  If you have an open presentation, case study or tutorial to share—or if you simply have suggestions for improvement—open an issue or submit a pull request.

### Looking ahead

This initiative is a starting point.  As new monitor surveys are acquired and new methods are developed, the site will evolve.  We plan to add sections on machine learning in 4D, integration with fibre‑optic data, data repositories and more.  We also hope to provide bilingual support (English and Chinese) to reach a wider audience.

By pooling our knowledge, we can lower the barriers to entry, foster best practices and ultimately enhance the value of 4D seismic for the entire industry.  We invite you to explore the site, share your expertise and help build a vibrant, self‑sustaining community.
